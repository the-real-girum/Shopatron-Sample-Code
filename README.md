I can't disclose any major code I wrote for Shopatron, Inc during my internship, but I can show off a sample script I wrote to automate the error code documentation process.

## Story behind this "Error Doc Maker"

Once upon a time during my first ever internship, I was called upon to scour through 20k lines of new product code to find and document all error codes.  Of course, I didn't want to do this, so I did what any coder would do: automate it for use forever.

Here lies said script~
